  wokwi_id:    347688030570545747        # If using wokwi, set this to your project's ID
#  source_files:        # If using an HDL, set wokwi_id as 0 and uncomment and list your source files here. Source files must be in ./src
#    - counter.v
#    - decoder.v
#  top_module:  "seven_segment_seconds"      # put the name of your top module here, make it unique by prepending your github username

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "BCD to 7-segment encoder"      # Project title
  description:  "Encode binary coded decimals (BCD) in the range 0..9 to 7-segment display control signals"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "The design has been fully generated using https://github.com/maehw/wokwi-lookup-table-generator and a lookup table (truth table) to translate a binary coded decimal (BCD) number to wokwi 7-segment display (https://docs.wokwi.com/parts/wokwi-7segment). Valid values are in the range 0..9, other values will show a blank display."      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "Control the input switches on the PCB and check the digit displayed on the 7-segment display."      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "Input switches and 7-segment display (should be on the PCB)"      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "wokwi" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
